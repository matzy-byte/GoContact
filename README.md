# GoContact
Life gets busy sometimes this small project should help remind you to get in touch with the people
you like. Setting up this list of contacts should be as easy as on the go-

## Description
Life gets busy and we just need a small notification to make the small effort the even just text a
small message. This is where this small application comes into play. Within the app you set up your
list of contacts you want to get in touch with more often.

## Installation
Figure it out yourself, maybe this section gets reworked.

## Usage
To add a contact you need to provide a first and last name, a priority value and the birthdate.
Also in the settings you are able to tweak the algorithm for selecting the next contact and
frequency of notification. When closing the application a cycle starts which will queue a
notification with a example message to get started with.

## Contributing
Currently I don't plan to accept contributions, although this is my personal learning project
working with Java and Android Studio.
